This is my Insight Data Science Project 
*** still very much under construction!!! ***
The naming conventions are awful, sorry!

you will want to use ./run.py under the hosting folder
The webpage info (input/output) is under the templates folder in flaskexample
The plots are sent to static in flaskexample

In flaskexample, scripts that control each tracker:
dataStats.py -> PolarLoop
readJawBone.py -> Jawbone
readTapiriik.py -> Endomondo
webScrapeFunctions.py -> weatherunderground API
views2.py -> controlling script 
plottingFunctions.py -> makes the plots and runs the predictive model

Polar Loop works the best, follwed by Jawbone. Endomondo is the most problematic of the three :(
